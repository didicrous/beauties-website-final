 			<h1> Our History </h1>
 			<p>Beauties and the Beat is the only female a cappella group at the University of Texas at Austin. We possess a unique set of talents and ambitions, but have joined forces to empower girls and women by slaying the stage and staying rooted in our community. Even though we have only existed since the fall of 2013, we have performed all over Austin - including being featured at Deke Sharon's Vocalosity concert this past spring - and we will be back for a third shot at ICCA this year. </p>

When Berkeley isn't doing school or Beauties, she's involved in Texas Spirits, Texas Rising, and was a Camp Texas counselor last summer! Her Pitch Perfect Dream is to have a Riff Off with the Songhorns and all the other groups on campus, and she's hoping to make that a reality this year!

This is her last year here at UT and she studies Computer Science. She spent this summer interning at IBM and hopes to later build software for the healthcare industry. When she isn't in the GDC, Didi likes to make fellow members of the a cappella community go run with her, doing things outside, going to Taco Joint and wondering if she will ever know the outcome of Serial Season One. She also made this website!</p>

She majors in Economics and minors in both Accounting and Spanish. Outside of class and Beauties, Alicia loves to rap (ask her about: learning Busta Rhymes' verse from "Look At Me Now" in 10 minutes or less), English culture, Dogspotting, the Oxford comma, and food - she prides herself on her restaurant recommendations. But her favorite thing in the world is a cappella. Though she had never sung before university, her time at UT would not be the same without her kind, talented, funny, and amazing musical pals!</p>

Mina is a self-proclaimed band geek whose favorite things are dogs, chipotle, Spotify, and online shopping (oh also really tall basses).</p>
